# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels.
  # If both are `0`, this setting is ignored.
  #dimensions:
  #  columns: 0
  #  lines: 0
  dimensions:
    columns: 80

  # Window position (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of pixels.
  # If the position is not set, the window manager will handle the placement.
  #position:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 0
    y: 4

  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
  dynamic_padding: false

  # Background opacity
  #
  # Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.
  # The value `0.0` is completely transparent and `1.0` is opaque.
  opacity: 1.0
  # opacity: 0.80

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  #     - full: Borders and title bar
  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  #
  # Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons
  #decorations: full

  # Startup Mode (changes require restart)
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode`:
  #   - Windowed
  #   - Maximized
  #   - Fullscreen
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode` (macOS only):
  #   - SimpleFullscreen
  #startup_mode: Windowed

  # Window title
  title: Alacritty

  # Window class (Linux/BSD only):
  class:
    # Application instance name
    instance: Alacritty
    # General application class
    general: Alacritty

  # GTK theme variant (Linux/BSD only)
  #
  # Override the variant of the GTK theme. Commonly supported values are `dark` and `light`.
  # Set this to `None` to use the default theme variant.
  #gtk_theme_variant: None

scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.
  history: 5000

  # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
  # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
  #multiplier: 3

  # Scroll to the bottom when new text is written to the terminal.
  #auto_scroll: false

# Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
#
# Some applications, like Emacs, rely on knowing about the width of a tab.
# To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
# change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.
#tabspaces: 8

# Font configuration
font:
  # Normal (roman) font face
  normal:
    # family: monospace
    family: Hack Nerd Font Mono

  # Point size
  size: 14.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upwards.

  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0


# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.
